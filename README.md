remote-slides
=============

A Keynote presentation, a bunch of remote folks to show the slides to and 45 minutes time: remote-slides

A very simple solution to give presentations to remote people and stay in control of which slide everyone sees at any time.

Install
-------

install `remote-slides` as a gem:

    gem install remote-slides


Usage
-----

Put all your slides as JPEG images (1024 x 768 px) in a otherwise empty folder. Then run:

    remote-slides path/to/that/folder
    
This creates an `index.html` file in the directory of your images. Just upload that whole folder to some webspace now.

Point your audience to the index.html file on your webspace.

To open the moderation interface go to: index.html#c that's it. You can go back and forth through your slides with the left and right arrow key.
